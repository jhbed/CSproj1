					The city of Montr&eacute;al was originally named Ville Marie and was founded in 1642 by Paul de Chomedey Maisonneuve. The name "Montr&eacute;al" was derived from the French name Mont Royal. In 1759 the British defeated the french colonists and the land was then occupied by the British. Even after the Brits defeated the French, they continued to thrive. In this time, colonies were developed all around the area including on the island.
